# Simpleton
## Design purposes
We want to design a platform-agnostic multithreaded high performance framework to build small games with. 

## How to setup
After syncing the branch, do 3 things (assuming you have git bash installed):
1. Update the submodules ("git submodule update --init" in bash) or simply use "git clone <link> --recursive"
2. Install Vulkan SDK: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home
3. Generate the project using CMake: https://cmake.org/download/
